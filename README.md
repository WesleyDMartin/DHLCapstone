## Admin Portal
### Login Page
This web application starts with a  login page. It will allow only the admin or anyone who might have access to the system to be able to login to the application. Upon entering the right username and password, the application will re-direct the user to the main admin page where the user will be able to customize the content.

### Admin Page
The admin page is basically a one stop stop for the user/admin. This is where the user will be able to add a new contents that will get added to the actual application.

The admin page has three different section. The first section shows the supported culture, the second section shows the list of questions that are being supported by the application and the third section shows the answers and the video content related to the question. All the sections has been described individually below.

#### Supported Culture
This section allows the user to add the list of cultures that will be supported by the DHL virtual cultural experience. The user need to write the name of the culture and click “submit” to be able to add the culture to the database. After adding all the cultures, the list of culture will show up in the *Culture* card. 

Since the list of cultures will grow over time and it will be time consuming for the user/admin to scroll through the list, pagination has been added. This will save the user a lot of time to just click next. Each list displays only five cultures at a time.

#### Supported Questions
This section allows the user to enter a list of questions that will be supported by the main VR application. To submit the questions, the user need to following steps. 
- Select the culture under which the questions will be listed

- Write the question in the section provided

- Write the answer related to the question that just has been added

- Add the link to youtube (2D) video or 360 video

- Submit

Also, since the list of questions will keep on increasing, it would be time consuming for the user to scroll through the questions. To enhance user experience, another pagination has been added there where a list of five questions will be displayed at a time.

#### Answer
After adding the list of questions and the answers, the user need to make sure that the answers are being displayed properly. To ensure that the answers are being displayed properly, the user has to select a culture, which will show the list of questions that has been added under the culture. Then the user need to select a question that he/she is  trying to find the answer for. After selecting the question, the answer will show up at the bottom of the page in the “Answer” section.
