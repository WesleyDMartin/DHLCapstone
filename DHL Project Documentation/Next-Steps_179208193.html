</div><h3 id="NextSteps-Summary">Summary</h3><p>The next steps for this project will be to improve upon all the individual components. There are lots of opportunities to develop this project and bring it to the next level, as the DHL would like to convert this project from a prototype to a completely up and functioning application. These will be the next steps needed for them to add it to their existing platform.</p><hr/><h2 id="NextSteps-EnhancingVRFunctionality">Enhancing VR Functionality</h2><p>Currently, the VR functionality has the ability to convert speech to text format when a user is asking a question to the guide. The text gets matched with the list of questions that have been added into the database for a culture. After the system finds a match, it will then display the right answer to the user in the virtual reality format or in a 2D video format. </p><p>The way this functionality can be enhanced is that the application can be updated in such a way so that the user will only have to provide a voice command, select the culture, ask the questions and get answers smoothly. Also, there could be more personal interaction with the system where a more realistic AI can be implemented. This will bring the user experience to the next level. Here are the possible next steps to improve the product.</p><ul><li><p>Support multi-language</p></li><li><p>Support multi-platform</p></li><li><p>Add more functionality</p></li><li><p>Implement AI</p></li></ul><h2 id="NextSteps-EnhancingtheAdminPortal">Enhancing the Admin Portal</h2><p>The admin portal is a very useful tool for anybody who will be managing the dynamic content of the VR application. Right now it is a very simple web application with basic functionalities. To enhance the Admin portal, the code can be re-factored into more manageable components. </p><p>All of the cultural content should be verified by some cultural experts in order to provide more authenticity. The UI elements can also be improved to provide better visuals for the user. Also, having a “Search” capability would be an excellent feature for the admin. This will allow the user to search for a culture and/or questions rather than browsing through the list of cultures and questions. </p><p>If any cultural professional is providing the cultural content for the application, then having a direct email capability from the Admin portal will be a nice touch. Here is a list of the next steps to improve the product.</p><ul><li><p>Support multi-language</p></li><li><p>Add search capabilities</p></li><li><p>Admin portal could be its own VR experience</p></li></ul><hr/><p />
