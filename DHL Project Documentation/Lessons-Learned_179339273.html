</div><h3 id="LessonsLearned-Summary">Summary</h3><p>This article talks about the different avenues that all the team members have visited and experienced. It shares what kind of lessons each team member has learned and the takeaways from this.</p><hr/><h2 id="LessonsLearned-TheBeginning"><strong>The Beginning</strong></h2><p>The beginning of this project seemed very promising and the team was very enthusiastic about this project. However, after more than a month of development, we introduced a large change in scope to the project. Although the team went through a bit of hurdle, we managed to switch gears and began to focus on the new scope of work which was to create a Virtual Reality experience for the users.</p><h2 id="LessonsLearned-ResearchandDevelopment"><strong>Research and Development</strong></h2><p>To get the ball rolling, we realized that with the degree to which our project was research dependent, our best goal was to split up various technical research aspects as well as the cultural research aspects. We enforced three times weekly standups as well as recurring mind mapping and brainstorming to ensure we were on the right track. This way of working helped carry us through the large change in scope, and the research we had done proved invaluable in completing the final product.</p><h2 id="LessonsLearned-AnUntimelyRoadblock"><strong>An Untimely Roadblock</strong></h2><p>The effects of global quarantine have been felt by everyone, and our team was no exception. Our team felt the impact almost immediately when we were no longer able to share development and time with the virtual reality hardware. We did our best to maintain weekly meetings and check-ins, as much for our own sanity as anything, however, the more of our project we got online, the better it became. In spite of the challenges, we were able to continue with Cultural content research and technical development, allowing us to reach complete the project well and on time.</p><h2 id="LessonsLearned-ProjectSuccess"><strong>Project Success</strong></h2><p>Having to deal with this unforeseen situation, team still managed to keep up morale. The biggest reason for the projectâ€™s success was this team's capacity to support each other in every way possible. Our team worked almost non-stop to make the best of this situation and use it to the team's advantage.</p><h2 id="LessonsLearned-TheWrap-up"><strong>The Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>The team has managed to wrap-up the project within the deadline and ship it. In the end, it was an incredible experience and there is a lot to take away from the lessons learned. It is not easy for any team to successfully deliver a project if the team members are not in sync. Also, if proper communication had not taken place, it could have created confusion and frustration amongst the team members.  In spite of all the risks and challenges to our product, we were able to deliver something that we are proud to call ours.</p><hr/>
